For my PhD I focus on developing and solving continuum mechanical models of lipid membranes, which play an important role in many cellular and sub-cellular processes. I am advised by [Kranthi Mandadapu](http://www.cchem.berkeley.edu/kranthi/){:target="_blank"}, and am supported by a [Computational Science Graduate Fellowship](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/about-doe-csgf){:target="_blank"}. 

I started by developing a [general theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06495){:target="_blank"} to model the dynamics of arbitrarily curved, deforming membranes. I am currently developing finite element simulations to solve the equations of motion and understand membrane behavior in different biologically relevant situations.
