I'm a first year chemical engineering Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley, advised by [Dr. Kranthi Mandadapu](http://www.cchem.berkeley.edu/kranthi/){:target="_blank"}. We are currently working on developing a comprehensive theoretical treatment of the cell membrane, using both continuum and statistical mechanics. My research is generously supported by the Department of Energy's [Computational Science Graduate Fellowship](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/about-doe-csgf){:target="_blank"}. You can learn more about my research interests [here](/research/).

I completed my undergraduate studies at Princeton University, where I received a Bachelor of Science in chemical engineering with minors in engineering physics and applied math. My senior thesis was advised by [Dr. Howard Stone](http://mae.princeton.edu/people/faculty/stone){:target="_blank"}, and focused on developing fuel cells that used bacteria to catalyze electricity generation. If you're interested, part of this research was [published](http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4cp01086h){:target="_blank"}.

Between Princeton and Berkeley, I worked in industry for three years -- one as an equity derivatives trader at the [Susquehanna International Group](http://sig.com/){:target="_blank"}, and two as a software engineer at [Redfin](https://www.redfin.com/){:target="_blank"}, a late-stage real estate startup. I highly recommend using Redfin if you're planning on buying or selling a home, and [here's why](https://www.redfin.com/why-redfin){:target="_blank"}.

My time in the technology sector strengthened my passion for the [open-source movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_movement){:target="_blank"}, and I bring this attitude with me into science. I share all of my results freely through a combination of pushing pre-prints to the [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/find/all/1/all:+AND+amaresh+sahu/0/1/0/all/0/1){:target="_blank"} and publishing in open-access journals.
