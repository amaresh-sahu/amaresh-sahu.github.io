Welcome to my blog! I was born and raised in Maryland, and grew up spending most of my time on either school or [table tennis](http://www.joolausa.com/Team-JOOLA/Team-JOOLA-Men/Amaresh-Sahu). I actually got pretty good at the latter, representing the U.S. as part of the 15 & Under team in 2006 and winning national titles at both the U.S. National Championships and the Junior Olympic Games. I stopped training seriously when I matriculated at Princeton University in 2009, although I [represented the school](http://www.princeton.edu/~puttc/archive.htm) all four years there.

I kept busy at Princeton mostly by studying chemical engineering and physics. I initially thought that I would start at a PhD program right after college, so I spent my first two summers of college doing research - the first at the [University of Maryland](http://appelbaumlab.umd.edu/), and the second at [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories](https://commons.lbl.gov/display/neatongroup/Home). I then decided to try my hand at a completely new set of problems, and worked as an Assistant Trader at the [Susquehanna International Group](http://www.sig.com/quantitative-trading/) my first year out of college. I ended up really missing the scientific method and approach to problem solving, and wanted to work in a more high-impact industry. I'm now interested in learning as much as I can about technology. I recently moved to San Francisco, and currently am working as a QA Engineer at [Redfin](https://www.redfin.com/). I am also working on a couple data science projects at [BeatDeck](http://www.beatdeck.com/) .

Other interests include watching tennis (mostly Nadal), reading Harry Potter, and cooking.
