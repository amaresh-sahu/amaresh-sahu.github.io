I'm a software developer at [Redfin](https://www.redfin.com/), a real-estate startup in San Francisco that is using technology to change how people buy and sell homes. Before Redfin, I was an assistant trader at the [Susquehanna International Group (SIG)](http://www.sig.com/quantitative-trading/), in the business of playing with money to make more money. Before SIG, I studied chemical engineering and physics at Princeton University. 

Outside of work, I'm interested in learning more physics, anything Elon Musk related, and better understanding why people make the decisions they do. I was one of the top junior table tennis players in the country, representing the U.S. nationally and internationally as part of the 15 & Under team and winning many titles at the U.S. National Championships and Junior Olympics.
