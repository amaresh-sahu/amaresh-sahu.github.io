  <p>
	I am interested in using mathematical techniques and scientific principles to understand various physical phenomena. I currently use continuum mechanics and non-equilibrium thermodynamics to understand lipid membranes.

			  <p>
			  I employ finite element methods to simulate non-axisymmetric membrane behavior, including viscous in-plane flow and elastic out-of-plane bending.
