This page is still under construction. It contains a little more detail than [my Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/amaresh-sahu/96/5ab/73), but you can check that for a more aesthetically pleasing summary of what I've been up to. I'm hoping to finish the formatting in the next day or two (as of 18 Dec. 2014) so check back soon!
