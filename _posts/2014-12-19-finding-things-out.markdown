This post is inspired by my wonderful experience reading [_The Pleasure of Finding Things Out_](http://www.amazon.com/The-Pleasure-Finding-Things-Out/dp/0465023959), by [Richard Feynman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman), as I traveled across Europe for the first time. The setting here was crucial: being a tourist in Europe means you go to a lot of historic churches, and doing so while reading about a scientist's point of view on religion was truly fascinating.

Before college: very pro-science, didn't believe in religion (myself) and didn't see its use to society

During college: still pro-science, still didn't believe in religion (myself) but was less strong. Could see possibilities where there is a good, saw that science didn't disprove religion, etc

During Europe trip: starting reading this book, and visited many famous places that were heavily influenced by religion. Ex: sagrada familia, duomo, etc. Saw how amazing these places were, and realized that none of this could have happened w/o religion. Gained a new respect for its ability to inspire people, even though I didn't think it was any more true

What I believe now:

Science is the right way to do things. We should try to get people as inspired from science as people used to be from religion. Certainly a difficult task. Also important in understanding other people's behavior re: religion.

# Possible Quotes:

> The remark which I read somewhere, that science is all right so long as it doesn't attack religion, was the clue that I needed to understand the problem

> The old problems, such as the relation of science and religion... are not often publicly discussed because of the limitations of specialization

> I didn't have much patience with what's called the humanities, even though in the university there were humanities that you had to take

> So altogether I can't believe these special stories that have been made up about our relationship to the universe at large

> I can live with doubt and uncertainty... I think it's much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong

> In religion, the moral lessons are taught, but they are not just taught once - you are inspired again and again

> So the question changes a little bit from "Is there a God?" to "How sure is it that there is a God?"

> [Religion] gives inspiration not only for moral conduct - it gives inspiration for the arts and for all kinds of great throughts and actions as well
