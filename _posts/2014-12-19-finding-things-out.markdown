To come: some of my thoughts on science, religion, and how my understanding of them grew as I read _The Pleasure of Finding Things Out_ while I was galavanting across Europe the summer after college.

***

When I started undergrad, I was one of those engineers who thought they had religion all figured out. I was a _scientist_, after all, and I believed in studying nature to figure out the unknown. To me, religion was a thing of the past - something people used to understand the world before they could use science to explain it. I felt particularly strongly about the following sentiment of [Paul Dirac](https://www.wikipedia.org/Paul_Dirac), the brilliant 20th century theoretical physicist:

> Dirac quote explaining why science trumps religion

Luckily, my views on this matter were constantly challenged as I came into contact with people of very different backgrounds. I still kept my views mostly the same, but perhaps became a little less harsh in criticizing religion. I realized it gave people a way of life, which I respected even though I still thought it inferior to science.

Then, once I graduated college, my perspecties on these ideas changed. It was a combination of traveling across Europe that summer and at the same time reading _The Pleasure of Finding Things Out_ by Richard Feynman. Feynman talked about religion in a way different to what I had ever thought of, and it was inspring to think about these ideas as I was visiting famous, historical churches all over Europe. It felt as though my mind was expanding as the trip went on, and I finished the book while still in Europe.

Include some things about what the book actually said.

I'm really glad that these things (Euroepe and book) happened at the same time, and then describe some of my current views on the matter.
