This post is inspired by my wonderful experience reading [_The Pleasure of Finding Things Out_](http://www.amazon.com/The-Pleasure-Finding-Things-Out/dp/0465023959), by [Richard Feynman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman), while I traveled across Europe for the first time. The setting was crucial: being a tourist in Europe means going to a lot of historic churches, and doing so while reading a physicist's thoughts on religion was truly fascinating.

Before this trip, my views on religion and how it relates to science were pretty similar to those of a stereotypical scientist or engineer. While I hope that many late-night discussions in college left some nuance to my beliefs, I generally felt that religion was a waste of people's time. I believed in the scientific way of thinking: continually questioning what you believe, because nothing is known with absolute certainty. Any system that taught people to think something without ever questioning it was directly going against the scientific way of thinking, and so I believed religion to be unimportant.

When I left my house to travel to Europe, I picked up the Feynman book so I wouldn't be bored on the plane. I got hooked almost immediately, but once I landed in Spain I was only able to read in short bursts in between meals and sightseeing. The science vs. religion debate was in the back of my mind as I visited [La Sagrada Familia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagrada_Fam%C3%ADlia), an enormous Roman Catholic church in Barcelona. It's a little unfortunate that this was the first church I visited, because it put the rest to shame. Between enormous stained glass windows, towering  pillars, and walking down a spiral staircase from the top, I was completely stunned. The place was _awesome_. And yet it was designed and created all in the name of religion - without a desire for churches, it would never have been built. I felt a strange twinge then, because I couldn't reconcile this with my dislike of religion.

My intermittent reading continued between a visit to the [Sistine Chapel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistine_Chapel), where I saw the famous [ceiling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistine_Chapel_ceiling) that Michelangelo painted, and a trip to the [Florence Cathedral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Cathedral), where I looked up at the Dome in awe. Time after time I was impressed at how people could come together and build incredible things - hundreds of years ago, no less! It wasn't just the buildings, either - art museum after art museum had religious paintings left and right. It was all making me feel slightly uneasy, as it wasn't consistent with my thoughts on religion.

And then something wonderful happened: I finished the last chapter of the book, titled 'The Relation of Science and Religion'. Feynman had figured out why I was confused, and after finishing the book I finally understood. He said there are three main aspects of religion: metaphysical, moral, and inspirational. My problems with religion are completely in the metaphysical realm, which "answers questions about what things are, where they come from, what man is, what God is - the properties of God, and so on." And my problems with the metaphysical aspects of religion remain today. But on the other hand, I had _completely_ overlooked the ability of religion to inspire people. It is very clear to me now that religion has a _tremendous_ ability to inspire people. Humans can devote their entire lives to religion, and in the process create things as magnificent as La Sagrada Familia or the Sistine Chapel. And the ability of religion to do that, to motivate people to do more than they otherwise could, is absolutely necessary in a discussion of religion. And this is why I'm so glad to have read this book while I was seeing all these inspiring buildings for the first time. It was, honestly, quite the pleasure to find these things out.

# Possible Quotes:

> The remark which I read somewhere, that science is all right so long as it doesn't attack religion, was the clue that I needed to understand the problem

> The old problems, such as the relation of science and religion... are not often publicly discussed because of the limitations of specialization

> I didn't have much patience with what's called the humanities, even though in the university there were humanities that you had to take

> So altogether I can't believe these special stories that have been made up about our relationship to the universe at large

> I can live with doubt and uncertainty... I think it's much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong

> In religion, the moral lessons are taught, but they are not just taught once - you are inspired again and again

> So the question changes a little bit from "Is there a God?" to "How sure is it that there is a God?"

> [Religion] gives inspiration not only for moral conduct - it gives inspiration for the arts and for all kinds of great throughts and actions as well
