This post is inspired by my wonderful experience reading [_The Pleasure of Finding Things Out_](http://www.amazon.com/The-Pleasure-Finding-Things-Out/dp/0465023959), by [Richard Feynman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman), while I traveled across Europe for the first time. The setting was crucial: being a tourist in Europe means going to a lot of historic churches, and doing so while reading a physicist's thoughts on religion was truly fascinating[^religion-intro].

Before this trip, my views on religion and how it relates to science were pretty similar to those of a stereotypical engineer. While I hope that many late-night discussions in college added some nuance to my beliefs, I generally felt that religion was a waste of people's time. I believed in the scientific way of thinking: continually questioning what you believe, because nothing is known with absolute certainty. Any system that taught people otherwise was contradicting this way of thinking, and thus I believed religion to be unimportant.

When I left my house to travel to Europe, I picked up the Feynman book so I wouldn't be bored on the plane. I got hooked almost immediately, but once I landed in Spain I was only able to read in short bursts in between meals and sightseeing. The science vs. religion debate was in the back of my mind as I visited [La Sagrada Familia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagrada_Fam%C3%ADlia), an enormous Roman Catholic church in Barcelona. It's a little unfortunate that this was the first church I visited, because it put the rest to shame. Between enormous stained glass windows, towering  pillars, and the view from the top, I was completely stunned. The place was _awesome_. And yet it was created in the name of religion: if people were not devout believers, they would never have been able to come together to build it. I felt a strange twinge then, because I couldn't reconcile this with my dislike of religion.

My intermittent reading continued between a visit to the [Sistine Chapel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistine_Chapel), where I saw the famous [ceiling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistine_Chapel_ceiling) that Michelangelo painted, and a trip to the [Florence Cathedral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Cathedral), where I looked up at the Dome in awe. Time after time I was impressed at how organized and determined people could be, creating these incredible buildings with the limited technology of centuries ago. It wasn't just the buildings, either - the art museums I visited were flooded with religious paintings. The whole experience was making me feel slightly uneasy, as it wasn't consistent with my thoughts on religion.

And then something wonderful happened. I finished the book, and the last chapter - 'The Relation of Science and Religion' - miraculously explaned the difficulty I was having. Feynman explains that there are three main components of religion: metaphysical, moral, and inspirational. The metaphysical aspect deals with why we are here and what God is like, and is the reason I dislike religion. But the inspirational component, which I had completely overlooked until this trip, explains how all these beautiful buildings were made. Inspiration is closely tied to the metaphysics, because people must work for God and feel close to him in order to be most inspired. And perhaps its closeness to metaphysics is why I didn't notice it at all.

To this day, I believe almost all of Feynman's conclusions about religion[^tradition]. I maintain that the metaphysical component is unscientific, but I now have a very strong appreciation for religion's ability to inspire. It is important for people who are non-religious to find other ways to be inspired, because this inspiration pushes humanity forward.

For now, I feel inspired learning from great scientists like Feynman, and I'm incredibly grateful to have picked up his book at the perfect time. It was, honestly, quite the pleasure to find these things out.


[^religion-intro]: While the book talks about much more than just religion, this is what I will focus on in the post. Furthermore, when I use the term 'religion' I assume this involves worship of one or more deities.

[^tradition]: I would include a fourth major component, that of tradition. Religion can play a major role during significant events (birth, marriage, and death) in addition to affecting daily or weekly routines (individual and group prayer).

# Possible Quotes:

> The remark which I read somewhere, that science is all right so long as it doesn't attack religion, was the clue that I needed to understand the problem

> The old problems, such as the relation of science and religion... are not often publicly discussed because of the limitations of specialization

> I didn't have much patience with what's called the humanities, even though in the university there were humanities that you had to take

> So altogether I can't believe these special stories that have been made up about our relationship to the universe at large

> I can live with doubt and uncertainty... I think it's much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong

> In religion, the moral lessons are taught, but they are not just taught once - you are inspired again and again

> So the question changes a little bit from "Is there a God?" to "How sure is it that there is a God?"

> [Religion] gives inspiration not only for moral conduct - it gives inspiration for the arts and for all kinds of great throughts and actions as well
