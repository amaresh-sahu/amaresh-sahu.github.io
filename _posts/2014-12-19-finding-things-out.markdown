To come: some of my thoughts on science, religion, and how my understanding of them grew as I read _The Pleasure of Finding Things Out_ while I was galavanting across Europe the summer after college.

***

When I started undergrad, I was one of those engineers who thought science and math were everything and the humanities were a waste of time. I had found history and English incredibly boring in high school, and I had no intention of wasting my precious college years studying subjects only related to humans while I could instead be focusing on Mother Nature and _her_ beautiful history, encompassing 13.8 billion years and the entire universe.

My attitude was pretty clearly reflected in what I did and who I hung out with. Most of my best friends were STEM majors, and I only was interested in math and science classes. I took some economics to satisfy half of my humanities requirements, because they were based on some simple math and so I didn't have to spend much time on them.
