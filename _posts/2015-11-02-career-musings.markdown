In a couple of hours I'll walk into the [Redfin](https://www.redfin.com/) headquarters in San Francisco, as I have been for just over a year, but for the first time as a software developer. It's been just shy of 500 days since I quite my job at the [Susquehanna International Group (SIG)](http://sig.com/), and I sure didn't expect it to take this long - but the crazy ride I've been on has been a lot of fun, and I'm happy with how things eventually turned out.

For starters, I quit my job at SIG because I could no longer stand spending all of my time thinking about money. I decided to be a software engineer at a startup because I wanted to write code that would immediately impact thousands, if not millions, of people. Despite a solid month of interview preparation, my first three final round interviews all ended in rejection. I then stepped back and worked on some personal projects to improve my overall coding skills, and by the time my next final round interview came around I told the recruiter to book me a one-way ticket to San Francisco. I wasn't leaving until I found a job.

To anyone looking for a job in tech, I highly recommend doing the same thing. Find some friends to crash with and talk to as many companies as you can - I probably talked to ten in the first two weeks after I landed. One of the most surprising commonalities were the phrases companies used: I was always hearing how a company had incredibly smart employees, and how it was going to change the world. Now, I'm not saying the people at these companies weren't smart - I just really felt that a lot of them were in it for the money. I'd had enough of that kind of thinking in finance, and knew that I wanted to work at a company with a mission I believed in and a culture I enjoyed. That's why even though the software test position at Redfin wasn't the developer role I desired, I went with it anyway. I could tell the culture at Redfin was quite simply amazing, and they had a mission I could stand firmly behind.

Growing as a software engineer at Redfin has been great - between writing test code and going to tech talks, I'm now way more prepared than I was a year ago. I know that I'm now going to have to work harder than ever to become a great developer, but I'm super excited to have the privelege to do so. From leaving SIG almost 500 days ago, I'm so grateful that Redfin gave me the opportunities to develop and excel in what I am most passionate about - and I look forward to seeing where this road will take me.
