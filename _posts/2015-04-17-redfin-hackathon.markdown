Two weeks ago, I participated in my first hackathon. It was hosted at my company, [Redfin](https://www.redfin.com/), and was a chance for engineers to come together and build features that they were passionate about or interested in. It was a week long event, and was without a doubt my favorite week at Redfin so far. 

For starters, a [hackathon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon#Origin_and_history) ("hack" + "marathon") is an event where small groups of people will work on a project that they find interesting, with the goal of having a finished (or at least demo-able) product at the end. Hackathons generally last somewhere between 24 hours and five days, and in this short amount of time it's difficult to get everything just right. In fact, it's often times hard to get things even _mostly_ right. And that means people have to cobble - or 'hack' - things together just to get things to work. These days, hackathons generally refer to people writing code (but it wasn't always that way).

I was part of a team that wanted to come up with an improved search experience. Redfin is a website where users can, among other things, look at homes to buy. Currently, you can enter a search region, and we'll show you a list of homes that match your search. You can filter houses by the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, price range, etc., but we don't give you the option to choose specific features of the house. For example, I really like gas stoves. If I was looking for a house, wouldn't it be nice if houses with gas stoves naturally came to the top of my list?

Well, our team certainly thought so. And so we decided to create a new feature where a user could select things that were important to them and then easily browse through homes that tended to have matching characteristics. For example, we asked users what kind of house architecture the preferred. If a user chose a style, then houses with that style moved closer to the top of the houses shown. By showing users several categories, we gave them enough options to get a very customized list of houses back.

I really enjoyed the fast-paced nature of the hackathon. Our team had to figure out exactly what would be possible in the five day time frame, and we had to constantly iterate our plans as we learned more about how difficult different parts of the feature would be. There was a ton of problem solving involved, as our team learned more and more about how to integrate this feature with the rest of the website. The last day and a half were particularly intense (and fun!) as everyone was working their hardest to finish everything in time. And in the end, we came up with a nice, clean, working product. I'm hoping that in a few months, we'll be able to work some more to bring this hackathon project to life, so it can be used by  consumers like you!
