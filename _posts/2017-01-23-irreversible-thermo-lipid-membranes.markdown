Today I pushed a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06495){:target="_blank"} on theoretically modeling cell membranes to the Arxiv.

### 30 second summary

Biological membranes play an important role in many cellular and sub-cellular processes, as we know from experiments. They are difficult to model, however, because there are complicated interactions between bending, flow, diffusion, and chemical reactions. In this paper, we determine the equations of motion governing membrane behavior in several biologically relevant examples.

### What's new: we...

- apply an irreversible thermodynamic framework to arbitrarily curved lipid membranes
- study the phase transition between liquid-ordered and liquid-disorderd domains in membranes with multiple species
- determine the driving force behind proteins binding to the membrane surface via chemical reactions
- study how phase transitions and chemical reactions are coupled to membrane bending and in-plane flow 

### Why is this interesting?

Far from playing a passive role in bounding cells and organelles, lipid membranes play an important role in preventing certain species from entering and exiting while allowing others. Furthermore, improperly functioning cell membranes have been linked to several diseases. By developing accurate models, we could better predict how new drugs interact with the cell membrane and better prevent the deterioration of cell membrane function.

### Why is this difficult?

Lipid membranes bend elastically out-of-plane to form complex shapes, but also flow in-plane like a two dimensional fluid. Not only are the bending and flow coupled to each other, but they also couple to processes like phase transitions and chemical reactions. The first challenge is to provide a suitable geometric description of the membrane, for which we turn to differential geometry. It is also difficult to determine the equation of motion in such coupled, complicated systems, for which we turn to irreversible thermodynamics and a balance law formulation.

### Longer summary

Biological membranes make up the boundaries of the cell and several of its internal organelles, including the mitochondria, nucleus, and endoplasmic reticulum. Such membranes act as selective barriers to different molecules and are responsible for cell survival.
Understanding the organization and behavior of biological membranes is important in many biological processes, including endo- and exo-cytosis, cell-cell signaling, and vesicle trafficking. While much has been learned about biological membranes through experiments, they are difficult to model wholistically due to interactions between membrane bending, surface flow and diffusion, and protein binding.
Modeling biological membranes is further complicated as they are two-dimensional objects that bend elastically out-of-plane and behave as a fluid in-plane. Consequently, the surface on which we develop the theory is itself curved and deforming over time.
Our work addresses this complexity by using a differential geometric setting, and we develop a comprehensive theoretical membrane model applicable to arbitrary membrane geometries for the first time.

A significant challenge in modeling membrane processes is understanding how they are coupled, as the physical state of a biological membrane at any instant in time may depend on chemical, thermal, and interrelated changes in the surroundings. Our work approaches this problem through the framework of irreversible thermodynamics by building on the classical developments of Ilya Prigogine, Sybren Ruurds de Groot, and Peter Mazur. Applying this framework to arbitrarily curved surfaces, we relate thermodynamic forces and fluxes and determine the governing equations of motion of biological membranes in several physically relevant examples.
