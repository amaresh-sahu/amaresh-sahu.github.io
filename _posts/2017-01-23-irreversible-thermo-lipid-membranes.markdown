My [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06495){:target="_blank"} on developing continuum models for arbitrarily curved lipid membranes was released on the Arxiv today. Here's a brief overview of what I did:

Biological membranes make up the boundaries of the cell and several of its internal organelles, including the mitochondria, nucleus, and endoplasmic reticulum. Such membranes act as selective barriers to different molecules and are responsible for cell survival.
Understanding the organization and behavior of biological membranes is important in many biological processes, including endo- and exo-cytosis, cell-cell signaling, and vesicle trafficking. While much has been learned about biological membranes through experiments, they are difficult to model wholistically due to interactions between membrane bending, surface flow and diffusion, and protein binding.
Modeling biological membranes is further complicated as they are two-dimensional objects that bend elastically out-of-plane and behave as a fluid in-plane. Consequently, the surface on which we develop the theory is itself curved and deforming over time.
Our work addresses this complexity by using a differential geometric setting, and we develop a comprehensive theoretical membrane model applicable to arbitrary membrane geometries for the first time.

A significant challenge in modeling membrane processes is understanding how they are coupled, as the physical state of a biological membrane at any instant in time may depend on chemical, thermal, and interrelated changes in the surroundings. Our work approaches this problem through the framework of irreversible thermodynamics by building on the classical developments of Ilya Prigogine, Sybren Ruurds de Groot, and Peter Mazur. Applying this framework to arbitrarily curved surfaces, we relate thermodynamic forces and fluxes and determine the governing equations of motion of biological membranes in several physically relevant examples.
